# Tesla Data Analysis Project Overview
The objective of the project is to analyze Tesla crash data to gain insights and understand the most notable causes for Tesla vehicle crashes. The dataset used in this project includes information about Tesla crashes such as: Case #,	Year,	Date,	Country,	State,	Description and	Deaths, among others.	

The project aims to evaluate Teslaâ€™s autopilot involvement in crashes reported by Tesla Owners and the safety of the vehicle itself. The analysis also looks into driver and copilot safety in comparison to third parties involved (pedestrians, other cars, motorcycles etc)

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis project consists of a collection of Tesla crash records. It includes various attributes related to each crash, such as:

Case #	
Year	
Date	 
Country 	 
State 	 
Description 	 
Deaths 	 
Tesla driver 	 
Tesla occupant 	 
Other vehicle 	 
Cyclists/ Peds 	 
TSLA+cycl / peds 	 
Model 	 
AutoPilot claimed 	 
Verified Tesla Autopilot Death 	 
Source 	 
Note 	 
Deceased

The dataset has been obtained from reliable sources, including official accident reports, insurance databases, and public records. It is important to note that all personal and sensitive information has been anonymized and removed to protect the privacy of individuals involved in the crashes. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

Methodology
The data analysis project follows a structured approach: 

Data Cleaning: The dataset was reviewed and outliers and irrelevant data points were either removed or appropriately handled.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): First, an analysis was conducted to identify the characteristics of the dataset, and then visualizations, summary statistics, and relationships between different variables were included. 

Statistical Analysis: We used Hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and correlation analysis to draw meaningful conclusions.

Visualization: Visual representations, such as graphs, charts, and maps, will be utilized to present the findings of the analysis in a clear and concise manner. 

Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies will be used in this data analysis project:

Programming Language: Python
Data Manipulation and Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Statistical Analysis Libraries: SciPy, StatsModels
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Jupyter Notebook or any other preferred IDE
Machine Learning Libraries (if applicable): Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (for advanced analysis or predictive modeling)
