THIS EVENT HAPPENED ON SEP 24. TESLA ADVISED ME TO TOW THE CAR TO THE SERVICE CENTER. SINCE THEN MY CAR HAS BEEN WITH TESLA SERVICE. THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN US ANY UPDATES ABOUT THE DIAGNOSTICS AND KEEP TELLING US TO TAKE THE CAR BACK. THEY HAVE CLEARED TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR 20 MILES. MY CAR WAS EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED. I REQUEST YOU TO HELP. THIS IS QUITE SERIOUS FOR THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE. WHILE I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT IF TESLA PROVES BEYOND A DOUBT THAT IT WAS MY ERROR, I AM QUITE CONFIDENT THAT IT DID IT AUTOMATICALLY. I AM ALSO CONCERNED THAT TESLA HAS NOT GIVEN US ANY UPDATE FOR THE LAST 3 WEEKS AND HAVE NOT PROVIDED US WITH ANY DETAILS OF WHAT THE COURSE OF ACTION IS BEYOND ASKING US TO TAKE THE CAR BACK AND CLEARING IT TO DRIVE FOR 20 MILES.

THIS ACTION COULD PROVE FATAL IF A BICYCLIST OR OTHER BIKES IN THE CATEGORY ARE IN FRONT. THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW.

5YJ3E1EA8KF****,2019 MODEL 3,1-Aug-19,26-Jul-19,"SAN JOSE, CA",11241215,"MY CAR WAS FIVE WEEKS OLD. WHILE I WAS DRIVING HOME ON MY COMMUTE I REALIZE THE SCREEN HAD FROZE, AND THEN SUDDENLY BLACKED OUT. I THOUGHT IT WAS A SOFTWARE UPDATE AS I AM A FAMILY THAT OWNS TESLA, BUT IT WASNT BECAUSE SUDDENLY THE ABILITY TO STEER AND BREAK OR COMPROMISED AND THE CAR HAD SPED WITHOUT ANY INDICATION AS TO WHY. I REPORTED IT TO TESLA AND THE EARLIEST THEY COULD SET FOR AN APPOINTMENT WITH SEVERAL WEEKS LATER. WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THIS INCIDENT INITIALLY OCCURRING, THIS HAPPENED AGAIN DURING TRAFFIC AND MY CAR INSTEAD OF BREAKING, INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY AND SMASHED INTO A CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I HAD CONTACTED. TESLA LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED I WAS VERY LUCKY BECAUSE I WASNT ON THE HIGHWAY, BUT 95% OF MY COMMUTE IS ON MAJOR HIGHWAYS IN THE BAY AREA. I SAID THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS AND I REALLY THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED UP FASTER, I GOT ZERO RESPONSE. SO WHEN THIS HAPPENED THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I COULD DO AND I ROLLED AND SPRAINED MY ANKLE VERY AGGRESSIVELY. NOT ONLY THAT BUT ALL OF THE AIRBAGS IN THE ENTIRE CAR MALFUNCTIONED EVEN THOUGH I WAS ABLE TO FOCUS THE BRUNT OF THE DAMAGE TO THE RIGHT FRONT. UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE BACK WINDOWS DIDNT OPEN NOR DID THE PASSENGER LOWER AIRBAG. THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT BUT IF THERE WAS THAT WOULD HAVE NOT GONE OFF AND THATS NOT OK. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AND THERE WERE NO UPDATES ON SOFTWARE THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN AND THE CAR WAS FIVE WEEKS OLD. TESLA HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE ME WITH THEIR DATA AND I HAVE AN SSD THAT SHOWS MY CAR SHUT DOWN."

5YJXCDE27JF****,2018 MODEL X,27-Nov-18,17-Nov-18,"SAN CLEMENTE, CA",11154380,"ON NOV 17, 2018 AT 4:50 PM, I WAS DRIVING MY TESLA X SLOWLY WITH AUTO PILOT OFF AND AUTO STEER OFF ON A SURFACE STREET IN SAN CLEMENTE, CA. I WAS TRYING TO DO A U TURN. I VERIFIED THAT THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC, THAT THERE WAS AN AREA WHERE CARS WERE NOT PARKED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STREET AND COULD USE A PARKING DRIVEWAY ON THE RIGHT THAT WILL ALLOW MORE SPACE TO PERFORM THE U TURN. I GENTLY PRESSED THE BREAK TO FURTHER SLOWDOWN AND THEN VEERED A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT INTO THE DRIVEWAY AT LESS THAN 5 MPH. I STARTED TO TURN TO THE LEFT WHILE STILL GENTLY PRESSING THE BREAK. AS SOON AS THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL LEFT THE DRIVEWAY AND BEFORE I HAD COMPLETED THE U TURN, THE TESLA ALL OF A SUDDEN, ON ITS OWN SPONTANEOUSLY ACCELERATED TO FULL POWER (A TESLA X CAN GO FROM 0-60 MILES IN APPROX. 4 SECONDS). MY FOOT WAS STILL ON THE BREAK, I DID NOT MOVE IT AND THEREFORE I DID NOT PRESS THE ACCELERATOR. THERE WERE NO OBJECTS OBSTRUCTING THE PEDALS. IN A SMALL FRACTION OF A SECOND, THE TESLA TRAVELED AT FULL SPEED TOWARDS THE TACOMA CAR PARKED AHEAD ON THE LEFT (LESS THAN 20 FEET). SOMETHING IN THE TESLA SYSTEM TRIGGERED THE SUDDEN SPONTANEOUS FULL ACCELERATION RESULTING IN THIS COLLISION. THE TESLA HAD MAJOR DAMAGE IN THE FRONT, THE AIR BAGS WERE DEPLOYED. I HAD A MAJOR BRUISE ON MY ABDOMEN AND SEVERAL SMALL BRUISES ON MY CHEST. THE TACOMA SUFFERED DAMAGE IN THE FRONT, MOVED BACKWARDS AND HIT THE CAR PARKED BEHIND IT. THERE WERE NO PASSENGERS IN THE OTHER VEHICLES. IT IS MY FIRM BELIEF THAT THIS ACCIDENT OCCURRED DUE NOT TO A DRIVERS ERROR BUT TO A TECHNOLOGICAL ERROR WITHIN THE TESLA VEHICLE. I FOUND MORE THAN 60 COMPLAINTS FOR SPONTANEOUS SUDDEN ACCELERATION FOR TESLA VEHICLES THAT HAVE BEEN FILED TO NHTSA. WHAT THESE COMPLAINTS HAVE IN COMMON ARE THAT VEHICLES ARE TRAVELING SLOWLY TRYING TO PARK OR MAKE TURNS AT LOW SPEED WHEN SUDDEN SPONTANEOUS FULL ACCELERATION WAS TRIGGERED."

THE FIRST TIME THIS OCCURRED WAS DURING MY FIRST WEEK WITH THE CAR AND WHEN I WAS SLOWLY DRIVING AROUND A TRAFFIC CIRCLE IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA AND THE CAR TOOK OFF ON ITS OWN. NO DAMAGE OTHER THAN MISALIGNMENT THAT TIME BUT I WAS VERY SCARED AND CALLED TESLA SERVICE. IT TOOK SEVERAL WEEKS FOR THEM TO RESPOND WITH THE DATA REPORT FROM THE CAR AND SAID THAT THE VEHICLE INCREASED SPEED DUE TO THE DRIVER PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR. I ACCEPTED THEIR EXPLANATION AND ASSUMED THAT I WAS INDEED AT FAULT EVEN THOUGH I WAS POSITIVE THAT I DIDNT PRESS THE ACCELERATOR. IM INCREDIBLY SADDENED BY THIS SITUATION AS I TRULY LOVED THIS CAR BUT IM TOO FRIGHTENED TO DRIVE IT AGAIN. ITS CURRENTLY AT A BODY SHOP."

I WAS TRYING TO SLOWLY TURN RIGHT FROM THE PARKING AISLE TO PARK BETWEEN TWO PICKUP TRUCKS ON EITHER SIDE OF MY STALL. WHEN I HAD TURNED PARTWAY INTO MY STALL, MY TESLA SUDDENLY ACCELERATED INTO MY PARKING STALL AT HIGH SPEED, HIT THE OUTSIDE CABLES, REBOUNDED BACKWARDS AND STOPPED ABOUT 10 FEET FROM THE OUTSIDE CABLES. THE CABLES SAVED ME FROM PLUNGING 3 FLOORS DOWN FROM THE GARAGE. THERE WAS EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE HOOD AND FRONT PORTIONS OF MY TESLA. THERE WAS ALSO SOME DAMAGE TO THE METAL CORRUGATED SHEETS OUTSIDE THE CABLES AND A SLIGHT DENT ON THE CORNER OF THE VEHICLE PARKED TO MY RIGHT.
 
 I HAVE BEEN PARKING IN MY OFFICE PARKING STALL FOR ABOUT THE PAST SIX MONTHS WITHOUT ANY ISSUE LIKE THIS. I WANT TO KNOW WHY MY CAR ACCELERATED LIKE THAT WITHOUT WARNING AND WHY THE COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM WAS NOT TRIGGERED BY THE OUTSIDE CORRUGATED METAL SHEET. 
 
 ALSO, THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH MY TESLA THE PREVIOUS EVENING. WHEN I TRIED TO START MY TESLA AFTER WORK, I GOT THE SYSTEMS ARE POWERING.. MESSAGE ON THE SCREEN AND MY CAR WOULD NOT START EVEN AFTER A LONG WAIT. THEN, I HAD TO GOOGLE TO FIND A WAY TO REBOOT THE CAR COMPUTER, BY PRESSING TWO BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL. ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT, I USED THE INTERMITTENT RAIN SENSING WIPERS FOR THE FIRST TIME, AS THERE WAS A LIGHT RAIN.

I'VE DONE SELF-PARK QUITE A FEW TIMES, AND EVEN WENT TO THE SALES CENTER TO CONFIRM THE WAY TO ENGAGE SELF PARK. WHEN THE VEHICLE SENSE THE SPACE AND YOU GO REVERSE, THE BLUE START BUTTON WILL BE ON SO YOU CAN PRESS AND LET THE AUTO SELF PARK. SADLY, THE SELF PARK CAUSED THE ACCIDENT ON 11/30/18 WHEN I WAS ON LYON STREET IN SAN FRANCISCO. WHEN PRESSED ON THE REVERSE 'START' BUTTON, THE CAR WENT UNCONTROLLABLY (LIKE A DEMON WAS IN THE CAR) AND HIT THE REAR PARKED CAR. I COULD BARELY HIT THE BRAKE IN TIME TO STOP THE ZOOMED REVERSE. THIS ACCIDENT NOT ONLY DAMAGED MY NEW MODEL 3 AND IT HIT THE BUMPER AND HEADLIGHT OF ANOTHER PARKED VEHICLE, THE INCIDENT TRULY TRAUMATIZED ME ON THE TESLA CAR FUNCTIONS. THANKFULLY, THERE WAS NOT ANY UPCOMING REAR TRAFFIC, WITH THE SELF REVERSE SPEED, THE ACCIDENT COULD BE A LOT WORSE. TESLA INSISTED THAT IT IS NOT AN AUTO-PILOT OR SELF-PARK ISSUE. THEY SAID WE HAVE TO WAIT 4 WEEKS FOR THE ENGINEERING REVIEW AND REPORT. AFTER WAITING FOR THE TESLA REPORT FOR 4 WEEKS, THEY CLAIMED THE VEHICLE WAS 'NOT' ENGAGED IN THE 'SELF-PARK' FUNCTION - WELL, WHY WOULD THE BLUE START BUTTON IS AVAILABLE FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE SELF PARK WAS READY????? THEY MADE THE EXCUSE THE CREEP FUNCTION WAS ACTIVATED. THAT IS RIDICULOUS! YOUR BLUE START BUTTON WAS AVAILABLE FOR SELF-PARK, DRIVER WOULD ASSUME THE VEHICLE IS READY TO BE PARKED. WHO WOULD GUESS THE VEHICLE WOULD ZOOM BACK UNCONTROLLABLY? COULD YOU IMAGINE HOW DANGEROUS THIS IS FOR ALL THE SELF PARK DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS? THE ACCIDENT COULD BE MUCH WORSE.

 AS I GENTLY APPLIED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO EASE FORWARD (AND TURN LEFT) OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE TO HEAD DOWN THE PARKING AISLE, THE CAR MOVED FORWARD MUCH FASTER THAN EXPECTED SO I LET OFF THE PEDAL. THE VEHICLE STOPS ACCELERATING AFTER LETTING OFF THE PEDAL. I TRY PRESSING THE PEDAL GENTLY AGAIN AND THE CAR LURCHES FORWARD PRETTY QUICKLY AS IF I DEPRESSED THE PEDAL ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN (I DID NOT). LETTING GO OF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL DIDN'T SEEM TO KICK IN REGENERATIVE BRAKING SO I PRESSED ON THE BRAKE TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN TO A SPEED APPROPRIATE FOR A PARKING LOT.
 
 AFTER USING THE BRAKE, THE PROBLEM NEVER REAPPEARED AND I RESUMED MY DRIVE ALTHOUGH I WAS SHAKEN A BIT BY THE INCIDENT.
 
 IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE ""THROTTLE MAP"" WAS MESSED UP FOR A FEW SECONDS ASKING THE CAR TO DELIVER MUCH HIGHER CURRENT THAN IT SHOULD HAVE AT A 5-10% PEDAL POSITION."

THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE PARKING SPACE POSITION WHEN IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED WITHOUT ANY INPUT FROM THE DRIVER. THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED HOWEVER THEY FELT INOPERATIVE. IT FELT AS THOUGH THE DRIVER HAD NO CONTROL OVER BRAKING AND THE VEHICLE HAD A MIND OF ITS OWN. THE DRIVER TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL TO AVOID DIRECTLY HITTING A DUMPSTER WHILE TRYING TO BRAKE. THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THEN HIT A CURB AND A PONY WALL. AFTER THE IMPACT, THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO TURN THE VEHICLE WHILE APPLYING THE BRAKES THAT EVENTUALLY BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO A STOP.

THE VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH ENHANCED AUTO PILOT WHICH WAS NOT ENGAGED AT THE TIME OF INCIDENT.

SINCE IT WAS FOR PARKING I CAN SURELY SAY THAT I DID NOT ACCELERATE THE CAR. THE STEERING AIR BAGS AND KNEE AIR BAGS CAME OFF AND ALSO THE PASSENGER SIDE KNEE AIR BAGS CAME OFF AS WELL. I SEARCHED ONLINE AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A CLASS ACTION SUITE ON THIS ISSUE BUT TESLA IS NOT ACCEPTING IT AS THE GLITCH IN THEIR SOFTWARE OR SOME OTHER COMPONENT. I FELT LIKE THE ACCELERATOR GOT PRESSED THE WAY WHEN THE CAR WAS IN CRUISE MODE. UNLESS I WANTED TO HIT THE WALL INTENTIONALLY THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ME TO PRESS THE ACCELERATOR TO SPEED FROM ALMOST ZERO TO WHATEVER THE HIGH SPEED IT ATTAINED AT THE TIME OF HITTING THE WALL.

I INFORMED TESLA THAT I AM POSITIVE BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT THAT THE CARS ELECTRONIC THROTTLE COMPUTER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCIDENT WHICH THEY DENY. THIS APPEARS TO BE THE INDUSTRY STANDARD SINCE EXPERTS WILL TESTIFY THAT ALTHOUGH A CAR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR UNINTENDED ACCELERATION THERE WILL BE NO TRACEABLE EVIDENCE OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND THEREFORE THE MANUFACTURER HAS PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY. TESLAS ARE UNDERGOING UNINTENDED ACCELERATION AT A RATE MORE FREQUENT THAN 1/5,000 VEHICLES MANUFACTURED. THIS IS WAY MORE FREQUENT THAN THE INDUSTRY STANDARD.

I SAW THAT I WAS IN THE POSITION THAT I COULD CONTINUE INTO THE GARAGE AND LIGHTLY PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR TO FINISH MY TURN INTO THE GARAGE. 
 
 IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT THE CAR ACCELERATED WITH EXTREME FORCE AND WITHIN A SECOND SLAMMED INTO A LARGE CONCRETE POLE THAT WAS JUST INSIDE THE GARAGE TO THE LEFT.
 
 I NEVER FELT THE CAR SLOW IN THAT MOMENT, ONLY SPEED UP AND I BELIEVE THE CAR SLAMMED INTO THE POLE WHILE ACCELERATING AND WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE IF NOT FOR THE LARGE POLE.

 I WAS NOT ON THE PHONE OR DISTRACTED IN ANY WAY. I WAS DRIVING CAREFULLY AND PAYING FULL ATTENTION. THIS IS NOT A CASE OF MISTAKEN PEDAL BECAUSE I WAS INTENDING TO ACCELERATE. 
 
 AT FIRST TESLA TOLD US OVER THE PHONE THAT THEIR LOGS SHOW THAT THE DRIVER PRESSED THE PEDAL 100% AND THEN TAPPED THE BRAKE BEFORE IMPACT. THIS EXPLANATION SOUNDED PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE DISTANCE COVERED WAS LESS THAN 3 CAR LENGTHS. A MONTH LATER TESLA SENT A LETTER STATING THE DRIVER PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR 100% UNTIL THE VEHICLE SENSED A CRASH. TESLA DID NOT RESPOND TO OUR QUERY ABOUT WHY THEIR LOG STORY HAD CHANGED. TESLA ALSO REFUSED TO PROVIDE DATA ABOUT ACCELERATOR/BRAKE PERCENTAGE AND CAR SPEED FOR THE CAR EARLIER IN THE DAY. IF A DRIVER IS PRESSING THE PEDAL 100% IT IS A VERY DELIBERATE ACTION.

 SUBMITTED BY REGINALHA ON DECEMBER 4, 2016
 
 I'M STILL SHAKING. I LOVED MY CAR UNTIL TODAY. I WAS GOING VERY SLOW INTO A PARKING SPACE WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND THE CAR ACCELERATED REALLY FAST AND INTO ANOTHER CAR. I PUSHED ON THE BRAKE SO HARD AND MY FOOT WAS STILL ON THE BRAKE WHEN THE CAR STOPPED (YES, I LOOKED). I THOUGHT THERE WAS INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM ON THIS FORUM BUT I CAN'T FIND IT. I'VE REPORTED IT TO TESLA. DAMAGE TO BOTH CARS ASIDE, I'M NOW AFRAID OF MY CAR! CAN SOMEONE TELL ME THE FORUM TO READ ABOUT OTHER'S EXPERIENCES? THANK YOU.

 I AM PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT EITHER THE CAR WOULD HAVE EMERGENCY BRAKED OR I WOULD HAVE HIT THE BUS HAD I LEFT IT ENGAGED. IT DEFINITELY PULLED FORWARD FULL-POWER LIKE IT DOES IF THE PERSON IN FRONT OF YOU CHANGES LANES AND THE LANE IS OTHERWISE CLEAR.

THERE WERE NO OTHER PASSENGERS IN THE CAR, AND THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT INJURY OR DAMAGE TO THE GARAGE OR OTHER CARS.

I WAS GOING TO PULL INTO ONE OF THOSE SPACES WHERE YOU CAN PARK PERPENDICULAR TO A SIDEWALK CURB AND THE SIDEWALK LEADS UP TO THE STORE FRONTS.
 
 WHEN APPROACHING THE PARKING SPACE, THE CAR WAS ALREADY IN REGENERATIVE BRAKING MODE, AND ACCORDING TO TESLAS LOGS, THE CAR SLOWED DOWN TO 3.5 MPH. SINCE THE CAR HAD ENOUGH MOMENTUM TO ROLL INTO THE SPACE ON ITS OWN, MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR OR THE BRAKE PEDAL. MY FOOT WAS UP RESTING ON ITS HEEL, READY TO TAP THE BRAKE WHEN IT GOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE CURB.
 
 WHILE THE CAR WAS COASTING INTO THE SPACE THE MOTOR WAS VERY QUIET. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEARD A WHIRRING SOUND FROM THE MOTOR. I DONT KNOW HOW BETTER TO DESCRIBE IT, THAN TO SAY IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THE MOTOR WENT FROM A STATE OF SLUMBER TO A FULL STATE OF AWARENESS.
 
 I BELIEVE THE MOTOR WAS WHIRRING LOUDLY FOR ABOUT A SECOND BEFORE THE CAR TOOK OFF AT SUCH A FAST PACE AND WOUND UP HITTING A BRICK WALL. IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY, I DIDNT HAVE ANY TIME TO REACT. AFTER THE IMPACT, I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED UNTIL I OPENED MY EYES AND SAW THE DEFLATED AIRBAGS IN THE CAR. IT LOOKED LIKE THE CAR JUMPED THE CURB, HIT THE BRICK WALL, BOUNCED BACKWARDS FROM THE IMPACT AND LANDED BACK INTO THE PARKING SPACE. 
 
 ACCORDING TO TESLAS LOGS, THE DATA READS THAT THE PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED DOWN TO 97% AND THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS DUE TO DRIVER ERROR. I STAND FIRMLY BY MY STATEMENT THAT MY FOOT WAS NOT ON EITHER THE ACCELERATOR OR THE BRAKE PEDAL WHEN THE CAR ACCELERATED. DATA MAY SHOW THERE WAS PEDAL DEPRESSION BUT I DID NOT DO THE DEPRESSING.

THIS CAR WAS DRIVEN MODERATELY IN THE FOLLOWING MONTHS. IN SEPTEMBER 14, 2015, THE CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN WITHIN A SMALL, ENCLOSED HOUSING COMPOUND. THE CAR WAS GOING VERY SLOW AS THE DRIVER WAS TURNING TO EXIT THE COMPOUND THROUGH A GATED ENTRANCE. THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED WITHOUT THE DRIVERS ASSISTANCE AND DROVE THROUGH THE TRAFFIC GATE BEFORE THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY BREAK AND BRING THE CAR TO A STOP. 
 
 ELECTRONIC RECORDS ACCESSED ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2015 REVEALED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: THE CAR WAS ORIGINALLY BEING DRIVEN AT 4.7 KM/HR WITH THE ACCELERATION PEDAL DEPRESSED AT 2.8%. WITHIN ONE SECOND, THE ACCELERATION PEDAL WENT FROM BEING DEPRESSED 2.8% TO 84.8% AND THE CAR INCREASED TO 10.75 KM/HR. DURING THE FOLLOWING SECOND, THE CARS RECORDS SHOW THE ACCELERATION PEDAL TO CONTINUE TO BE COMPRESSED AT 84% WITH THE SPEED INCREASING TO 18.35 KM/HR, BUT WITH THE BREAK PEDAL ALSO BEING SIMULTANEOUSLY COMPRESSED. IN THE SUBSEQUENT SECOND, THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES INITIATED, AND THE CAR WAS BROUGHT TO A STOP A SECOND LATER. 
 
 WE REJECT THE DEALERSHIPS DECISION THAT THIS WAS DRIVERS ERROR. IN SUCH A NARROW ENVIRONMENT AS THE HOUSING COMPOUND, AND DURING A SLOW AND CONTROLLED TURN, THERE THE DRIVER HAD NO REASON TO PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON THE ACCELERATION PEDAL AS THE RECORDS SHOW  WHETHER INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONAL. WE ALSO FEEL THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR THE DRIVER TO PUSH BOTH THE ACCELERATOR AND BREAK PEDAL TO SUCH A DEGREE SIMULTANEOUSLY. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CAR EXPERIENCED AN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION, WHICH WAS NOT OF THE DRIVERS CAUSING. 
 
 THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SIMILAR REPORTS OF TESLA MODEL S UNINTENDED ACCELERATION CRASHES IN CHINA. WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD WHICH NEEDS TO BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED."

INSTEAD OF STOPPING, THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD OVER A CURB AND A BERM, STOPPING WHEN IT HIT A FIRE HYDRANT, PROPELLING IT OFF OF ITS BOLTS, GENERATING A HUGE GEYSER OF WATER. 
 
 BECAUSE OF THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WATER GUSHING OVER MY CAR, I HAD NO VISIBILITY AND ELECTED TO STAY IN THE CAR WHILE ATTEMPTING TO DIAL 911. MOMENTS LATER, A MAN WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE CAR NEXT TO THE SPACE WHERE I WAS ATTEMPTING TO PARK, OPENED THE BACK DOOR TO ASK ABOUT MY CONDITION. I THEN EXITED THE CAR. 
 
 I WAS NOT INJURED AND THANK GOODNESS THE CAR HAD NOT HIT ANOTHER PERSON OR ANOTHER CAR. IT TOOK A TOW TRUCK ABOUT 15 MINUTES TO ARRIVE AT THE SCENE. ALL THE WHILE THE TORRENTIAL WATER SURGED AROUND, UNDER AND OVER MY CAR AND NOW FLOODED THE INTERIOR. ACCORDING TO TESLA, EITHER THE CAR SHORTED-OUT CAUSING ALL OF THE WINDOWS TO ROLL DOWN OR THERE IS A SAFETY FEATURE THAT CAUSES THE WINDOWS TO ROLL DOWN IF THE CAR PERCEIVES IT IS UNDER WATER. 
 
 THE MAN WHO BRAVED THE FLOOD OF WATER FROM THE FIRE HYDRANT TO CHECK ON ME SAW THE ENTIRE ACCIDENT AS HE WAS SITTING IN HIS CAR. HE SAID THAT MY BREAK LIGHTS WERE ON AS MY CAR WENT OVER THE BERM. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CAUSED THE CAR TO ACCELERATE BY ITSELF AND I AM CERTAIN THAT MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.
 
 THE NEXT DAY, I HEARD FROM BOTH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE BODY SHOP THAT TESLA WANTED THE CAR AT THEIR SERVICE CENTER IN VAN NUYS. SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, THE CLAIMS ADJUSTER CALLED TO SAY THAT DUE TO THE HEAVY WATER DAMAGE, THE CAR HAS BEEN “TOTALED”.

THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AND I WAS STUNNED. 
 
 I IMMEDIATELY CALLED TESLA WHO SENT A QUALIFIED TESLA TOW TRUCK. IT TOOK TWO HOURS TO GET THE CAR ONTO A FLAT-BED TRUCK BECAUSE THE CAR LOST ALL POWER AND SHUT DOWN. IT HAD TO BE DRAGGED OVER TWO PARKING BLOCKS, SUSTAINING EVEN MORE DAMAGE. TESLA SENT THE CAR DIRECTLY TO THE BODY SHOP. I INSISTED THAT THEY RUN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST BECAUSE I WAS (AND STILL AM) CERTAIN THAT THE CAR ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN. THE VAN NUYS SERVICE CENTER REP SAID THAT THE CAR HAD TO BE REPAIRED FIRST BEFORE ANY DIAGNOSTIC TEST COULD BE RUN. AFTER THREE WEEKS I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM TESLA. THE ENGINEERS REPORTED TO ME THAT THE ACCELERATOR WAS DEPRESSED TO 48%, SECONDS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT AND 98.4% AT THE TIME OF IMPACT. I STILL BELIEVE THAT THE CAR ACCELERATED BY ITSELF.
 
 IT IS MY SINCERE HOPE THAT BY REPORTING THIS ACCIDENT (AND THE SUBSEQUENT ACCIDENT ON JULY 16, 2015) FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS CAN BE CONDUCTED BEFORE PEOPLE ARE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR WORSE.

THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS WHEREIN, WHEN A DRIVER MAKES A SHARP TURN INTO A DRIVEWAY OR GARAGE AND APPLIES THE BRAKE, RATHER THAN SLOWING DOWN CAR JUST DECIDES TO SPEED UP LIKE A BULLET AND GOES THROUGH THE WALLS OR WHATEVER COMES ITS WAY. I HAVE STOPPED DRIVING FOR FORESEEABLE FUTURE, I AM NOT GOING TO PUT MY STEP IN ANOTHER TESLA FOR MY SAFETY AND SAFETY OF OTHERS. STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY FOR YOUR/OTHERS"

A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES SUSTAINED BY THE CONTACT. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED AND DEEMED DESTROYED. A DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE.

N/A,2013 MODEL S,26-Jan-18,29-Nov-17,"SAN ANTONIO, TX",11065308,"DRIVER STOPPED CAR WHILE PULLING INTO GARAGE WITH REAR WHEELS ON DRIVEWAY SLOPING DOWN AND AWAY FROM GARAGE AND FRONT WHEELS JUST INSIDE GARAGE. VEHICLE CREEP MODE IN OFF POSITION. CAR AT REST. BRAKE RELEASED, AND VEHICLE BEGAN ROLLING BACKWARD DUE TO GRAVITY. ACCELERATOR APPLIED, AND NO INITIAL RESPONSE, CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE BACKWARD ROLL SPEED, SO PEDAL DEPRESSED FURTHER (TESLA VEHICLE LOGS SHOW 25-50% PEDAL TRAVEL AT THIS POINT), AT WHICH TIME DRIVE UNIT QUICKLY ENGAGED AT 25-50% OF FULL ACCELERATION RESULTING IN A SUDDEN UNINTENTIONAL FORWARD ACCELERATION. DRIVER CAUGHT BY SURPRISE AND ATTEMPTED BRAKING. UNFORTUNATELY, VEHICLE IMPACTED FREEZER UNIT IN GARAGE DESTROYING THE FREEZER AND CAUSING SIGNIFICANT VEHICLE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE. THIS SET OF OPERATING PARAMETERS WAS REPRODUCIBLE AND RELIABLY RESULTED IN A SHORT, BUT NOTABLE, DELAY IN PEDAL RESPONSE WHEN ROLLING BACKWARD, RESULTING IN FURTHER PEDAL DEPRESSION, THEN FOLLOWED BY A SUDDEN ACCELERATION FORWARD, WHICH WAS SHORT, BUT, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BE SIGNIFICANT WHEN COLLISION HAZARDS EXIST NEARBY. THE VEHICLE OPERATING MANUAL CONTAINS NO WARNING REGARDING THIS SITUATION. TESLA WAS MADE AWARE AND WOULD ONLY COMMENT THAT THE VEHICLE DID NOT MALFUNCTION. WHILE THAT MAY BE THE CASE, THE VEHICLE DESIGN SETS UP DRIVERS FOR ACCIDENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT IN INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE WHEN DRIVERS ARE NOT WARNED OF THE VEHICLE'S RESPONSE IN THIS UNIQUE OPERATING CIRCUMSTANCE. AT THE VERY LEAST, IT SEEMS, TESLA SHOULD INCLUDE A WARNING TO DRIVERS ABOUT THIS SITUATION SO THAT DRIVERS MIGHT BE READY FOR SUDDEN ACCELERATIONS IN SUCH INSTANCES, OR DRIVERS MIGHT SIMPLY SELECT CREEP MODE ON IN SUCH SITUATIONS, WHICH WOULD PREVENT THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION."
5YJSA1CN0DF****,2013 MODEL S,2-Mar-16,24-Feb-16,"PLEASANTON, CA",10839579,"SLOWLY PULLING INTO A PARKING SPOT AT A STRIP MALL, I RELEASED MY FOOT OFF OF THE GAS, LIGHTLY TAPPED BRAKE AND THE CAR ""UNINTENTIONALLY ACCELERATED"" INTO A PALM TREE IN FRONT OF A BRICK PILLAR AT A STRIP MALL. I BACKED OUT TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE. HUSBAND WAS WITNESS IN DRIVER'S SEAT. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME THIS HAPPENED TO ME, (LAST YEAR AT A GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT) ALTHO THE FIRST TIME NO DAMAGE WAS DONE AND NO REPORTS WERE FILED. POOR DECISION IN HINDSIGHT! SINCE NO PERSON WAS INJURED, THE POLICE DEPT WOULD NOT TAKE A REPORT. INSURANCE WAS CALLED AS WELL AS TESLA. TESLA TOOK 6 DAYS TO PULL LOGS AND ASSURED US IT WAS BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND ESCALATED TO MANAGEMENT. WE RECEIVED A CALL YESTERDAY FROM TOSHA AT TESLA, RELAYING THAT THEY DETERMINED THAT T WAS DRIVER ERROR AND LOG REPORTS SHOW THAT AS THE CAR WAS PULLING INTO THE SPOT, IT WAS ON A 3 ON A SCALE OF 100 AND THEN IT ACCELERATED 87% AND THE BRAKE WAS APPLIED. DOES NOT MAKE LOGICAL SENSE THAT THE CAR COULD ACCELERATE 87% IN A MATTER OF 2 FEET! I AM 150% SURE I DID NOT HIT THE ACCELERATOR. I AM 47, NOT A 90 YR OLD WOMAN WHO MAY HAVE PEDAL CONFUSION. THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED WITH ANY OF OUR OTHER NON-TESLA CARS NOR IN MY 40+ YEARS OF DRIVING CARS OR MOTORCYCLES. THEIR RESPONSE IS SUSPECT AND WE ARE QUITE FRANKLY FEARFUL TO DRIVE THE CAR SAFELY. THIS STIP MALL HAS LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT WALK BY, ESP ELDERLY AND THE FACT THAT NO ONE OR THE PILLAR WAS HIT IS A BLESSING. AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. I WILL BE ASKING TESLA FOR A WRITTEN REPORT OF THEIR FINDINGS BUT NOT CONFIDENT IT WILL BE PROVIDED. WE PLAN TO SEEK COUNSEL AS WELL ESP SINCE THIS IS CONSIDERED AN ""AT FAULT ACCIDENT""."

THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED. IT HIT A CURB AND THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE CAR LANDED ON A 4.5 FT HIGH VERTICAL RETAINING WALL. THE WALL IS ONE FOOT AWAY FROM THE CURB. THE FRONT PORTION OF THE CAR WAS HANGING UP IN THE AIR. THE CAR WAS AT ABOUT 45 DEGREE UP AND ABOUT 20 DEGREE TILTED TOWARD THE RIGHT SIDE. AN ENGINEER FROM TESLA SAID THE RECORD SHOWED THE ACCELERATING PEDAL WAS STEPPED ON AND IT ACCELERATED FROM 18% TO 100% IN SPLIT SECOND. HE BLAMED MY WIFE STEPPING ON THE ACCELERATING PEDAL. BUT HE ALSO SAID THERE WAS A BUILT-IN SAFE-GUARD THAT THE ACCELERATOR COULDNOT GO BEYOND 92%. THE STATEMENTS ARE CONTRADICTORY. IF THERE IS A SAFEGUARD THAT THE ACCELERATOR CANNOT GO BEYOUND 92%, THERE WOULD BE NO WAY THAT MY WIFE COULD STEP ON IT 100%. THERE WERE SOME MECHANICAL PROBLEM THAT CAUSED THE ACCELERATOR TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN FROM 18% TO 100% IN SPLIT SECOND. *LN UPDATED 12/30/2013 *JS"

WHEN IT WAS CLEAR OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC FOR ME TO MAKE THE LEFT TURN, I RELEASED MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE CAR INSTANTLY SURGED FORWARD VERY FAST AND HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE PARKED IN THE FRONT OF THE GARAGE. THIS ALL HAPPENED SO QUICKLY THAT I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO AVOID THE IMPACT. THE TIME OF OCCURRENCE WAS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AT ABOUT 6PM PST.
 
 I HAVE DRIVEN THIS CAR FOR ALMOST 10000 MILES PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT AND KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THE CAR AND UNDERSTAND THE TORQUE THIS CAR HAS. I HAVE MADE THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF STOPS AND STARTS WITH THIS VEHICLE AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED. THERE IS NO OTHER TERM TO DESCRIBE THIS OTHER THAN SUDDEN ACCELERATION.
 
 THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT DISPATCHED AN OFFICER AND NO DRUGS OR ALCOHOL WAS INVOLVED. *JS
 
 TESLA INSTRUCTED THEIR STAFF TO NOT COMMUNICATE WITH ME ABOUT THIS ACCIDENT. *JS"
